ATLib is a C# AT command library that abstracts away the commands and makes it easy to communicate with modems.

Hayes command set (commonly known as AT commands) is a command set frequently used in modems. Read more about it at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set).

ATLib is just in the beginning. Currently only a few commands are implemented, but more will come.

[HeboTech.GsmApi](https://github.com/hbjorgo/GsmApi) is a REST API wrapping this library.

Feedback is very much welcome ðŸ™‚

## Supported commands:
- Send SMS
- List SMSs
- Read SMS
- Delete SMS
- Set SMS message format (to text)
- Dial number
- Answer incoming call
- Hang up call
- Get SIM status
- Enter SIM PIN
- Get remaining PIN & PUK attempts
- Get product information
- Get battery status
- Get signal strength
- Get date and time
- Set date and time
- Disable echo
- Some modems may also support modem specific commands

## Events
- Incoming call
- Missed call
- Call started
- Call ended
- SmsReceived (not fully implemented)

## Supported modems:
- Adafruit FONA 3G (based on SIMCOM SIM5320 chipset)
- D-Link DWM-222 (based on Qualcomm MDM9225 chipset)
- TP-LINK MA260 (based on a Qualcomm chipset)
* Other modems may work using one of the implementations above

## Usage
Install as NuGet package
```shell
dotnet add package HeboTech.ATLib
```

Using a serial port to communicate with a modem is easy:
```csharp
// Set up serial port
using SerialPort serialPort = new SerialPort(args[0], 9600, Parity.None, 8, StopBits.One)
{
    Handshake = Handshake.RequestToSend
};
serialPort.Open();

// Create AT channel
using AtChannel atChannel = new AtChannel(serialPort.BaseStream);

// Create the modem
using IModem modem = new Fona3G(atChannel);

// The library doesn't support echo, so turn it off
await modem.DisableEchoAsync();

// Get SIM status
var simStatus = await modem.GetSimStatusAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"SIM Status: {simStatus}");

if (simStatus == SimStatus.SIM_PIN)
{
    var simPinStatus = await modem.EnterSimPinAsync(new PersonalIdentificationNumber("<PIN>"));
    Console.WriteLine($"SIM PIN Status: {simPinStatus}");
}

// Send SMS to the specified number
var smsReference = await modem.SendSMSAsync(new PhoneNumber("0123456789"), "Hello ATLib!");
Console.WriteLine($"SMS Reference: {smsReference}");
```
Because it relies on a stream, you can even control a modem over a network! Either use a network attached modem, or forward a modem serial port to a network port.
